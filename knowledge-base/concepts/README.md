## üéØ Quick Reference

### Essential Concepts
- **State**: The data that flows through your graph
- **Nodes**: Functions that process state
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes
- **Graph**: The complete workflow structure

### Key Principles
- **Stateful**: Applications maintain context
- **Composable**: Build from smaller parts
- **Observable**: Monitor and debug easily
- **Scalable**: Handle production workloads

## üìù Contributing

When adding new concept documents:

1. **Use the template**: Follow the [concept template](../TEMPLATES.md)
2. **Keep it focused**: One concept per document
3. **Include examples**: Always provide code examples
4. **Cross-reference**: Link to related concepts
5. **Update this index**: Add new documents to the appropriate section
